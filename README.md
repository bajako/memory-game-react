# Memory game

This is a simple game created to improve my JS/React skills. 

## Getting Started

You can:
* look it up and play here - [GitHub Pages](https://bajako.github.io/memory-game-react/). <br /><br />
* run it on your local machine.<br /><br />
  To do so - download the project, open a terminal in the folder that contains the project and use command:
  ```
  npm install
  ```
  It will install all dependencies (listed in **package.json**) that you need to enjoy the game.
  
  Next, if you have your **webpack** installed globaly type:
  ```
  webpack
  ```
  And if you don't, use:
  ```
  ./node_modules/.bin/webpack
  ```
  Last thing - open index.html file in your browser and enjoy!
