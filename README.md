# Memory game

This is a simple game created to improve my JS/React skills. 

## Few words about it...
It has difficulty levels.<br />
Thanks to the use of localStorage, results are saved in the browser's memory, even after it's
closed.<br />
This simple game is created in React, I use Webpack.<br />
RDW is based on CSS Grid.

### Few screenshots:

## Getting Started

You can:
* look it up and play here - [GitHub Pages](https://bajako.github.io/memory-game-react/). <br /><br />

  To do so - download the project, open a terminal in the folder that contains the project and use command:

  It will install all dependencies (listed in **package.json**) that you need to enjoy the game.
  
  Next, if you have your **webpack** installed globally type:

  Last thing - open index.html file in your browser and enjoy!
